• 👨‍💻  my goal is to be able to always be learning about coding/programming since it is what i always wanted to work with.                      
• 📈 I'm on github because i want to make a historic archive, showing my evolution as a student and serve as an example for others students.        
• 🎮 When talking about hobbies, i like playing games, Studying math and watching anime.
